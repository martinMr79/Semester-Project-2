Bargain Basement Auction is a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items listed by other users.

When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use for bidding on items. Users can earn additional credits by selling items, and they can utilize their credits to purchase items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can place bids on items.
